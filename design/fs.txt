All of pistons files are installed in the `/piston` directory. This directory
contains all runtimes, config, packages and cache that piston uses.

Each package gets its own directory, where it its prebuilt binaries are
unpacked into. This is contained within `/piston/packages`

The binaries folder contained within this is then symlinked into the runtimes
directory. This is where all the different runtimes available are placed. This
is contained within the `/piston/runtimes` directory.

The cache directory a directory containing all the different cache files. It is
recommended to either sym-link this into a folder withing /tmp/ or directly
mount it as a tmpfs filesystem.

Configuration is stored in a single file - piston.yaml and contains all
documentation required for configuring the piston API
